Do not upload to anywhere, and do not include RAGE Plugin Hook in your plugin releases, without prior written permission.

You can find the licenses for the libraries used by RAGE Plugin Hook in the 'Licenses' folder.

Installation:
Put everything into the game folder, except the 'SDK' and 'Licenses' folders, then run RAGEPluginHook.exe.

For developers:
Reference SDK\RagePluginHookSDK.dll in your plugins.
For development, we recommend running the game in windowed borderless mode.

For documentation, visit http://ragepluginhook.net and go to the Documentation tab.
The documentation tab also has a page with images of all Ped models, and a list of all 35000+ animations.

Example plugins can be found on the website. You will need to re-add the reference to SDK\RagePluginHookSDK.dll.
